<p class="mx-paragraph"> Traffic to the Governor’s site decreased slightly in June compared to May. With many popular press releases this month, the “news” page was the top visited page. Top releases included: Gov. Hochul directed NYPA to develop a zero-emission nuclear energy plant, state of emergency declared for heat and thunderstorms, and NY becoming the first large state in the nation with a bell-to-bell cell phone ban.</p>

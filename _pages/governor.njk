<p class="mx-paragraph"> After a huge jump in traffic in August compared to July, the governorâ€™s site continued to see more visitors in September, with an 7% increase from August. This is still mainly due to the Phone-free schools program page, which is being promoted with a digital ad campaign. The press release on Inflation Refund Checks also received heavy traffic.</p>

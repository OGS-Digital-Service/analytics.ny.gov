<p class="mx-paragraph"> After big jumps in traffic in previous months, traffic declined 42% in November. The top press release was <em>Governor Hochul Declares State of Emergency and Initiates New Actions in Response to Trump Administration Cutting Off Food Assistance </em>and the top program page was <em>Impact of Federal Cuts on New Yorkers: Take Action & Share Your Story.</em> November lacked a major weather event and announcement compared to October that saw strong numbers from a Statewide Burn Ban and the Inflation Refund Check announcement.</p>
